The problem was caused by an unintended conflict with other CSS properties and a misunderstanding of how flexbox works. The solution lies in understanding how the `width` property interacts with `display: flex` and removing any conflicting rules.

Here's the corrected CSS code:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%; /* Ensure container takes full width */
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  margin: 5px;
  flex-shrink: 0; /* Prevent items from shrinking below their minimum width */
}
```

By explicitly setting the `width` of the container and adding `flex-shrink: 0` to the `.item` class, the elements are now correctly aligned horizontally. This ensures that the flex items maintain their minimum size and don't shrink to zero width causing the vertical stacking.
