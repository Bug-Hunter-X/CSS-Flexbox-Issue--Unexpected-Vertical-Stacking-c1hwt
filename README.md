# CSS Flexbox Issue: Unexpected Vertical Stacking

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue with CSS Flexbox where elements within a flex container stack vertically despite setting `display: flex`.  The issue is resolved by addressing a possible conflict with other CSS properties or an improper implementation of flexbox properties.

## Bug Report
The provided CSS code uses flexbox to arrange elements horizontally. However, the elements are stacking vertically instead of horizontally. The problem is rooted in a conflict or misunderstanding of flexbox implementation details, often overlooked by developers.

## Solution
The solution involves identifying and correcting the root cause of the vertical stacking. This might include ensuring that the flex container has the correct sizing, or checking for conflicting properties.
