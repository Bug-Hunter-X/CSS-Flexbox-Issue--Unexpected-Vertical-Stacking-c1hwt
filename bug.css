The following CSS code snippet is causing unexpected behavior in the rendering of my web page.  The `.container` class is not responding to the `display: flex;` property, and elements within the container are stacking vertically instead of horizontally. 

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 100%;
}

.item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  margin: 5px;
}
```

I've inspected the HTML structure and ensured that the elements are properly nested within the `.container` element. However, the expected horizontal alignment is not achieved.
